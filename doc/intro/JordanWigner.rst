Fermions and the Jordan-Wigner transformation
=============================================

The `Jordan-Wigner transformation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan-Wigner_transformation>`_
maps fermionic creation- and annihilation operators to (bosonic) spin-operators.


Spinless fermions in 1D
-----------------------
Let's start by explicitly writing down the transformation.
With the Pauli matrices :math:`\sigma^{x,y,z}_j` and :math:`\sigma^{\pm}_j = (\sigma^x_j \pm \mathrm{i} \sigma^y_j)/2` on each site,
we can map 

.. math ::
    n_j         &\leftrightarrow (\sigma^{z}_j + 1)/2        \\
    c_j         &\leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_l} \sigma^{-}_j             \\
    c_j^\dagger &\leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_l} \sigma^{+}_j  

The :math:`n_l` in the second and third row are defined in terms of Pauli matrices according to the first row.
We do not interpret the Pauli matrices as spin-1/2; they have nothing to do with the spin in the spin-full case.
If you really want to interpret them physically, you might better think of them as hard-core bosons 
(:math:`b_j =\sigma^{-}_j, b^\dagger_j=\sigma^{+}_j`),
with a spin of the fermions mapping to a spin of the hard-core bosons.

Note that this transformation maps the fermionic operators :math:`c_j` and :math:`c^\dagger_j` to *global* operators; although they carry an index `j` indicating
a site, they actually act on all sites ``l <= j``!
Thus, clearly the operators ``C`` and ``Cd`` defined in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite` do *not* directly correspond to :math:`c_j` and
:math:`c^\dagger_j`.
The part :math:`(-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_l}` is called Jordan-Wigner string and in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite` is given by the local operator 
:math:`JW := (-1)^{n_l}` acting on all sites ``l < j``.
Since this important, let me stress it again:

.. warning ::
    The fermionic operator :math:`c_j` (and similar :math:`c^\dagger_j`) maps to a *global* operator consisting of
    the Jordan-Wigner string built by the local operator ``JW`` on sites ``l < j`` *and* the local operator ``C`` (or ``Cd``, respectively) on site ``j``.

On the sites itself, the onsite operators ``C`` and ``Cd`` in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite` fulfill the correct anti-commutation relation, without the need to include ``JW`` strings.
The ``JW`` string is necessary to ensure the anti-commutation for operators acting on different sites.

Written in terms of `onsite` operators defined in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite`, 
with the `i`-th entry in the list acting on site `i`, the relations are thus::

    ["JW", ..., "JW", "C",  "Id", ..., "Id"]   # for the annihilation operator
    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cd", "Id", ..., "Id"]   # for the creation operator
    
Note that ``"JW"`` squares to the identity, ``"JW JW" == "Id"``, 
which is the reason that the Jordan-wigner string completely cancels in :math:`n_j = c^\dagger_j c_j`. 
In the above notation, this can be written as::

    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cd",  "Id", ..., "Id"] * ["JW", ..., "JW", "C", "Id", ..., "Id"]
    == ["JW JW", ..., "JW JW", "Cd C",  "Id Id", ..., "Id Id"]      # by definition of the tensorproduct
    == ["Id",    ..., "Id",    "N",     "Id",    ..., "Id"]         # by definition of the local operators
    # ("X Y" stands for the local operators X and Y applied on the same site. We assume that the "Cd" and "C" on the first line act on the same site.)

For a pair of operators acting on different sites, ``JW`` strings have to be included for every site between the operators.
For example, taking ``i < j``, 
:math:`c^\dagger_i c_j \leftrightarrow \sigma_i^{+} (-1)^{\sum_{i <=l < j} n_l}  \sigma_j^{-}`. 
More explicitly, for ``j = i+2`` we get::

    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cd", "Id", "Id", "Id", ..., "Id"] * ["JW", ..., "JW", "JW", "JW", "C", "Id", ..., "Id"]
    == ["JW JW", ..., "JW JW", "Cd JW",  "Id JW", "Id C", ..., "Id"] 
    == ["Id",    ..., "Id",    "Cd JW",  "JW",    "C",    ..., "Id"] 

In other words, the Jordan-Wigner string appears only in the range ``i <= l < j``, i.e. between the two sites *and* on the smaller/left one of them.
(You can easily generalize this rule to cases with more than two :math:`c` or :math:`c^\dagger`.)

This last line (as well as the last line of the previous example) can be rewritten by changing the order of the operators ``Cd JW`` to ``"JW Cd" == - "Cd"``.
(This is valid because either site ``i`` is occupied, yielding a minus sign from the ``JW``, or it is empty, yielding a 0 from the ``Cd``.)

This is also the case for ``j < i``, say ``j = i-2``:
:math:`c^\dagger_i c_j \leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{j <=l < i} n_l} \sigma_i^{+} \sigma_j^{-}`. 
As shown in the following, the ``JW`` again appears on the left site,
but this time acting *after* ``C``::

    ["JW", ..., "JW", "JW", "JW", "Cd", "Id", ..., "Id"] * ["JW", ..., "JW", "C", "Id", "Id", "Id", ..., "Id"]
    == ["JW JW", ..., "JW JW", "JW C",  "JW", "Cd Id", ..., "Id"] 
    == ["Id",    ..., "Id",    "JW C",  "JW", "Cd",    ..., "Id"] 




Higher dimensions
-----------------
For an MPO or MPS, you always have to define an ordering of all your sites. This ordering effectively maps the
higher-dimensional lattice to a 1D chain, usually at the expense of long-range hopping/interactions.
With this mapping, the Jordan-Wigner transformation generalizes to higher dimensions in a straight-forward way.


Spinful fermions
-----------------

.. image :: /images/JordanWignerSpinHalf.*

As illustrated in the above picture, you can think of spin-1/2 fermions on a chain as spinless fermions living on a ladder (and analogous mappings for higher dimensional lattices).
Each rung (a blue box in the picture) forms a :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.SpinHalfFermionSite` 
which is composed of two :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite` (the circles in the picture) for spin-up and spin-down.
The mapping of the spin-1/2 fermions onto the ladder induces an ordering of the spins, as the final result must again be a one-dimensional chain, now containing both spin species.
The solid line indicates the convention for the ordering, the dashed lines indicate spin-preserving hopping :math:`c^\dagger_{s,i} c_{s,i+1} + h.c.` 
and visualize the ladder structure.
More generally, each species of fermions appearing in your model gets a separate label, and its Jordan-Wigner string
includes the signs :math:`(-1)^{n_l}` of *all* species of fermions to the 'left' of it (in the sense of the ordering indicated by the solid line in the picture).

In the case of spin-1/2 fermions labeled by :math:`\uparrow` and :math:`\downarrow` on each `site`, the complete mapping is given (where `j` and `l` are indices of the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite`):

.. math ::
    n_{\uparrow,j} &\leftrightarrow (\sigma^{z}_{\uparrow,j} + 1)/2                                                                                  \\
    n_{\downarrow,j} &\leftrightarrow (\sigma^{z}_{\downarrow,j} + 1)/2                                                                              \\
    c_{\uparrow,j} &\leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_{\uparrow,l} + n_{\downarrow,l}} \sigma^{-}_{\uparrow,j}                                    \\
    c^\dagger_{\uparrow,j} &\leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_{\uparrow,l} + n_{\downarrow,l}} \sigma^{+}_{\uparrow,j}                           \\
    c_{\downarrow,j} &\leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_{\uparrow,l} + n_{\downarrow,l}} (-1)^{n_{\uparrow,j}} \sigma^{-}_{\downarrow,j}          \\
    c^\dagger_{\downarrow,j} &\leftrightarrow (-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_{\uparrow,l} + n_{\downarrow,l}} (-1)^{n_{\uparrow,j}} \sigma^{+}_{\downarrow,j} \\

In each of the above mappings the operators on the right hand sides commute; we can rewrite
:math:`(-1)^{\sum_{l < j} n_{\uparrow,l} + n_{\downarrow,l}} = \prod_{l < j} (-1)^{n_{\uparrow,l}} (-1)^{n_{\downarrow,l}}`,
which resembles the actual structure in the code more closely.
The parts of the operator acting in the same box of the picture, i.e. which have the same index `j` or `l`, 
are the 'onsite' operators in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.SpinHalfFermionSite`:
for example ``JW`` on site `j` is given by :math:`(-1)^{n_{\uparrow,j}} (-1)^{n_{\downarrow,j}}`, 
``Cu`` is just the :math:`\sigma^{-}_{\uparrow,j}`, ``Cdu`` is :math:`\sigma^{+}_{\uparrow,j}`,
``Cd`` is :math:`(-1)^{n_{\uparrow,j}} \sigma^{-}_{\downarrow,j}`.
and ``Cdd`` is :math:`(-1)^{n_{\uparrow,j}} \sigma^{+}_{\downarrow,j}`.
Note the asymmetry regarding the spin in the definition of the onsite operators:
the spin-down operators include Jordan-Wigner signs for the spin-up fermions on the same site. 
This asymmetry stems from the ordering convention introduced by the solid line in the picture, according to which the spin-up site
is "left" of the spin-down site. With the above definition, the operators within the same :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.SpinHalfFermionSite` fulfill the expected commutation relations,
for example ``"Cu Cdd" == - "Cdd Cu"``, but again the ``JW`` on sites left of the operator pair is crucial to get the correct
commutation relations globally.

.. warning ::
    Again, the fermionic operators :math:`c_{\uparrow,j}, c^\dagger_{\uparrow,j}, c_{\downarrow,j}, c^\dagger_{\downarrow,j}` correspond to  *global* operators consisting of
    the Jordan-Wigner string built by the local operator ``JW`` on sites ``l < j`` *and* the local operators ``'Cu', 'Cdu', 'Cd', 'Cdd'`` on site ``j``.

Written explicitly in terms of onsite operators defined in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.sites.FermionSite`,
with the `j`-th entry entry in the list acting on site `j`, the relations are::

    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cu",  "Id", ..., "Id"]    # for the annihilation operator spin-up
    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cd",  "Id", ..., "Id"]    # for the annihilation operator spin-down
    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cdu",  "Id", ..., "Id"]   # for the creation operator spin-up
    ["JW", ..., "JW", "Cdd",  "Id", ..., "Id"]   # for the creation operator spin-down

As you can see, the asymmetry regarding the spins in the definition of the local onsite operators ``"Cu", "Cd", "Cdu", "Cdd"`` lead to a symmetric definition in the global sense.
If you look at the definitions very closely, you can see that in terms like ``["Id", "Cd JW", "JW", "Cd"]`` the
Jordan-Wigner sign :math:`(-1)^{n_\uparrow,2}` appears twice (namely once in the definition of ``"Cd"`` and once in the ``"JW"`` on site
2) and could in principle be canceled, however in favor of a simplified handling in the code we do not recommend you to cancel it.
Similar, within a spinless :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite`, one can simplify ``"Cd JW" == "Cd"`` and ``"JW C" == "C"``, 
but these relations do *not* hold in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.SpinHalfFermionSite`, 
and for consistency we recommend to explicitly keep the ``"JW"`` operator string even in nearest-neighbor models where it is not strictly necessary.


How to handle Jordan-Wigner strings in practice
-----------------------------------------------

There are only a few pitfalls where you have to keep the mapping in mind:
When **building a model**, you map the physical fermionic operators to the usual spin/bosonic operators.
The algorithms don't care about the mapping, they just use the given Hamiltonian, be it given as MPO for DMRG or as nearest neighbor couplings for TEBD.
Only when you do a **measurement** (e.g. by calculating an expectation value or a correlation function), you have to reverse this mapping.
Be aware that in certain cases, e.g. when calculating the entanglement entropy on a certain bond,
you cannot reverse this mapping (in a straightforward way), and thus your results might depend on how you defined the Jordan-Wigner string.

Whatever you do, you should first think about if (and how much of) the Jordan-Wigner string cancels.
For example for many of the onsite operators (like the particle number operator ``N`` or the spin operators in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.SpinHalfFermionSite`)
the Jordan-Wigner string cancels completely and you can just ignore it both in onsite-terms and couplings.
In case of two operators acting on different sites, you typically have a Jordan-Wigner string inbetween (e.g. for the
:math:`c^\dagger_i c_j` examples described above and below) or no Jordan-Wigner strings at all (e.g. for density-density
interactions :math:`n_i n_j`).
In fact, the case that the Jordan Wigner string on the left of the first non-trivial operator does not cancel is currently not supported
for models and expectation values, as it usually doesn't appear in practice.
For terms involving more operators, things tend to get more complicated, e.g. :math:`c^\dagger_i c^\dagger_j c_k c_l` with
:math:`i < j < k < l` requires a Jordan-Wigner string on sites `m` with :math:`i \leq m <j` or :math:`k \leq m <l`, but
not for :math:`j < m < k`.

.. note ::
    TeNPy keeps track of which onsite operators need a Jordan-Wigner string in the :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.Site` class,
    specifically in :attr:`~tenpy.networks.site.Site.need_JW_string` and :meth:`~tenpy.networks.site.Site.op_needs_JW`.
    Hence, when you define custom sites or add extra operators to the sites, make sure that 
    :meth:`~tenpy.networks.site.Site.op_needs_JW` returns the expected results.

When **building a model** the Jordan-Wigner strings need to be taken into account. 
If you just specify the `H_MPO` or `H_bond`, it is *your* responsibility to use the correct mapping.
However, if you use the :meth:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel.add_coupling` method of the 
:class:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel` ,
(or the generalization :meth:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel.add_multi_coupling` for more than 2 operators),
TeNPy can use the information from the `Site` class to *automatically add Jordan-Wigner* strings as needed.
Indeed, with the default argument ``op_string=None``, `add_coupling` will automatically check whether the operators
need Jordan-Wigner strings and correspondingly set ``op_string='JW', str_on_first=True``, if necessary.
For `add_multi_coupling`, you can't even explicitly specify the correct Jordan-Wigner strings, but you **must use**
``op_string=None``, from which it will automatically determine where Jordan-Wigner strings are needed.

Obviously, you should be careful about the convention which of the operators is applied first (in a physical
sense as an operator acting on a state), as this corresponds to a sign of the prefactor.
Read the doc-strings of :meth:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel.add_coupling`
:meth:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel.add_multi_coupling` for details.

As a concrete example, let us specify a hopping
:math:`\sum_{i} (c^\dagger_i c_{i+1} + h.c.) = \sum_{i} (c^\dagger_i c_{i+1} + c^\dagger_{i} c_{i-1})`
in a 1D chain of :class:`~tenpy.networks.site.FermionSite` with :meth:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel.add_coupling`.
The recommended way is just::

    self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cd', 0, 'C', 1, plus_hc=True) 

If you want to specify both the Jordan-Wigner string and the ``h.c.`` term explicitly, you can use::

    self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cd', 0, 'C', 1, op_string='JW', str_on_first=True) 
    self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cd', 0, 'C', -1, op_string='JW', str_on_first=True)

Slightly more complicated, to specify the hopping
:math:`\sum_{\langle i, j\rangle, s} (c^\dagger_{s,i} c_{s,j} + h.c.)`
in the Fermi-Hubbard model on a 2D square lattice, we could use::

    for (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (0, 1)]:
        self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cdu', 0, 'Cu', (dx, dy), plus_hc=True)  # spin up
        self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cdd', 0, 'Cd', (dx, dy), plus_hc=True)  # spin down

    # or without `plus_hc`
    for (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:  # include -dx !
        self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cdu', 0, 'Cu', (dx, dy))  # spin up
        self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cdd', 0, 'Cd', (dx, dy))  # spin down

    # or specifying the 'JW' string explicitly
    for (dx, dy) in [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]:
        self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cdu', 0, 'Cu', (dx, dy), 'JW', True)  # spin up
        self.add_coupling(strength, 0, 'Cdd', 0, 'Cd', (dx, dy), 'JW', True)  # spin down


The most important functions for doing **measurements** are probably :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.expectation_value`
and :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.correlation_function`. Again, if all the Jordan-Wigner strings cancel, you don't have
to worry about them at all, e.g. for many onsite operators or correlation functions involving only number operators.
If you build multi-site operators to be measured by `expectation_value`, take care to include the Jordan-Wigner
string correctly.

Some MPS methods like
:meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.correlation_function`,
:meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.expectation_value_term` and
:meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.expectation_value_terms_sum` automatically add Jordan-Wigner strings 
(at least with default arguments).
Other more low-level functions like :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.expectation_value_multi_sites` don't do it.
Hence, you should always watch out during measurements, if the function used needs special treatment for Jordan-Wigner strings.
