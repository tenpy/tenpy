- Fixed a bug in the :class:`~tenpy.models.hofstadter` models, where the symmetric gauge was not
  implemented correctly and yielded a different physical model. Removed the config options for
  controlling the magnetic unit cell size, since in all well-configured cases they had no effect.
  See :pull`527` for details.
