- Fix an error where two-site TDVP did not correctly handle ``explicit_plus_hc``.
  If the explicit part of the Hamiltonian (without the plus hc) is non-Hermitian,
  this should lead to an error in the Krylov evolution.
  However, if the explicit part is already hermitian, it silently does a wrong calculation.
