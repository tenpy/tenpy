- Improve implementation of optimized 4-th order Suzuki-Trotter decomposition for the
  :class:`~tenpy.algorithms.tebd.TEBDEngine`. When evolving by multiple steps without stopping,
  we can merge the last operator of one step with the first operator of the next step, as we already
  do for the other orders 2 and 4.
