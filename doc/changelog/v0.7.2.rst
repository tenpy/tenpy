[0.7.2] - 2020-10-09
====================

Release Notes
-------------
We've added a list of all papers using (and citing) TeNPy, see :doc:`/papers_using_tenpy`. Feel free to include your own works!

And a slight simplicifation, which might affect your code: 
using the `MultiCouplingModel` is no longer necessary, just use the :class:`tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel` directly.

Changelog
---------

Backwards incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- Deprecated the :class:`tenpy.models.model.MultiCouplingModel`. 
  The functionality is fully merged into the :class:`~tenpy.models.model.CouplingModel`, no need to subclass the
  `MultiCouplingModel` anymore.
- The :class:`~tenpy.models.lattice.Kagome` lattice did not include all `next_next_nearest_neighbors`.
  (It had only the ones across the hexagon, missing those maiking up a bow-tie.)
- Combined arguments `onsite_terms` and `coupling_terms` of :meth:`tenpy.networks.mpo.MPOGraph.from_terms` into
  a single argument `terms`.

Added
^^^^^
- Allow to include jupyter notebooks into the documentation; collect example notebooks in [TeNPyNotebooks]_.
- :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.term_correlation_function_right` and 
  :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.term_correlation_function_left`
  for correlation functions with more than one operator on each end.
- :class:`tenpy.networks.terms.ExponentiallyDecayingTerms` for constructing MPOs with exponential decay,
  and :meth:`tenpy.networks.model.CouplingModel.add_exponentially_decaying_coupling` for using it.
  This closes :issue:`78`.

Fixed
^^^^^
- The :class:`~tenpy.models.lattice.IrregularLattice` used the ``'default'`` order of the regular lattice instead of
  whatever the order of the regular lattice was.
- :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.charge_variance` did not work for more than 1 charge.
