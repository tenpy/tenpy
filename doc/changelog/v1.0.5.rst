[v1.0.5] - 2025-02-21
=====================

Release Notes
-------------
A few minor addition and bugfixes.

Changelog
---------

Added
^^^^^
- The :class:`~tenpy.models.pxp.PXPChain`, a model describing Rydberg physics.
- The :class:`~tenpy.models.molecular.MolecularModel` class for quantum chemistry applications.

Changed
^^^^^^^
- The consistency checks are now more robust towards errors. If performing the check itself
  causes an error (e.g. because of wrong types or missing attributes), we handle the exception
  and emit only a warning

Fixed
^^^^^
- Fixed a bug in :meth:`tenpy.networks.mpo.MPO.to_TermList`. A one-off error when handling
  the ``max_range`` parameter caused some long range terms to be missing.
- Fixed a bug in the comparison of :class:`~tenpy.linalg.charges.LegCharge`\ s, see :issue:`470`.
- Fixed multiple bugs in the consistency checks: We had bugs for ExpMPOEvolution with imaginary time
  and for DMRG with the IrregularLattice.
