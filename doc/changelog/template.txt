Backwards incompatible changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- For infinite MPS (:class:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS` with ``bc='infinite'``), we now only store
  ``L`` singular values instead of ``L + 1`` in the :attr:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS._S` attribute.
  The ``_S[L]`` entry always was equal to ``_S[0]`` anyway. With the incorporation of shift-symmetry,
  i.e. symmetries that depend on spatial position, we need to distinguish the concept of
  the singular values to the right of the last site from the singular values left of the first site,
  since they differ by a spatial translation.
  Singular values should only be accessed via the methods :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.get_SL`,
  :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.get_SR`, :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.set_SL`,
  and :meth:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPS.set_SR` which account for these spatial translations.

Added
^^^^^
- A new base class :class:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPSGeometry` that abstracts common properties and
  methods of tensor networks with the linear geometry of e.g. MPS. The MPO class, as well as
  Environments also subclass from :class:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPSGeometry`.
  Most notably, a new attribute :attr:`~tenpy.networks.mps.MPSGeometry.unit_cell_width` was introduced.
  It is also an argument to the ``__init__`` and most classmethods of MPS, MPO, etc.
  For backwards-compatibility, it is optional for now, with a default value that assumes a Chain
  lattice. It will become mandatory in some future release.
