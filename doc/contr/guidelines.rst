Coding Guidelines
=================

To keep consistency, we ask you to comply with the following guidelines for contributions.
However, these are just guidelines - it still helps if you contribute something, even if doesn't follow these rules ;-)

- Use a code style based on :pep:`8`.
  The git repo includes a config file ``.style.yapf`` for the python package `yapf <http://github.com/google/yapf>`_.
  `yapf` is a tool to auto-format code, e.g., by the command ``yapf -i some/file`` (-i for "in place").
  We run yapf on a regular basis on the github main branch.
  If your branch diverged, it might help to run yapf before merging.

  .. note ::

    Since no tool is perfect, you can format some regions of code manually and enclose them 
    with the special comments ``# yapf: disable`` and ``# yapf: enable``.

- Every function/class/module should be documented by its doc-string, see :pep:`257`.
  We auto-format the doc-strings with `docformatter <https://github.com/myint/docformatter>`_ on a regular basis.

  Additional documentation for the user guide is in the folder ``doc/``.

  The documentation uses `reStructuredText`. If you are new to `reStructuredText`, read this `introduction <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_.
  We use the `numpy` style for doc-strings (with the `napoleon <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html>`_ extension to sphinx).
  You can read about them in these `Instructions for the doc strings <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html>`_.
  In addition, you can take a look at the following `example file <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc/blob/main/doc/example.py>`_.
  Helpful hints on top of that::

        r"""<- this r makes me a raw string, thus '\' has no special meaning.
        Otherwise you would need to escape backslashes, e.g. in math formulas.

        You can include cross references to classes, methods, functions, modules like
        :class:`~tenpy.linalg.np_conserved.Array`, :meth:`~tenpy.linalg.np_conserved.Array.to_ndarray`,
        :func:`tenpy.tools.math.toiterable`, :mod:`tenpy.linalg.np_conserved`.
        The ~ in the beginning makes only the last part of the name appear in the generated documentation.
        Documents of the userguide can be referenced with :doc:`/intro_npc` even from inside the doc-strings.
        You can also cross-link to other documentations, e.g. :class:`numpy.ndarray`, :func`scipy.linalg.svd` and :mod: will work.

        Moreover, you can link to github issues, arXiv papers, dois, and topics in the community forum with
        e.g. :issue:`5`, :arxiv:`1805.00055`, :doi:`10.1000/1` and :forum:`3`.

        Citations from the literature list can be cited as :cite:`white1992` using the bibtex key.

        Write inline formulas as :math:`H |\Psi\rangle = E |\Psi\rangle` or displayed equations as
        .. math ::

           e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0

        In doc-strings, math can only be used in the Notes section.
        To refer to variables within math, use `\mathtt{varname}`.

        .. todo ::

           This block can describe things which need to be done and is automatically included in a section of :doc:`todo`.
        """

- Use relative imports within TeNPy. Example::

      from ..linalg import np_conserved as npc

- Use the python package `pytest <https://pytest.org>`_ for testing.
  Run it simply with ``pytest`` in `tests/`.
  You should make sure that all tests run through, before you ``git push`` back into the public repo.
  Long-running tests are marked with the attribute `slow`; for a quick check you can also run
  ``pytest -m "not slow"``.
  
  We have set up github actions to automatically run the tests.

- Reversely, if you write new functions, please also include suitable tests!

- Preserve backwards compatibility as far as possible.
  If you change how a feature works, or how it is accessed or what its function signature is,
  keep the deprecated version around with suitable deprecation warnings.
  Issue a ``DeprecationWarning`` or ``FutureWarning`` when the deprecated implementation is used.
  A common pattern for deprecated classes is to subclass from the new implementation and override
  methods as needed.
  Use the ``.. deprecated ::`` directive in the docstring and describe what should be used instead.
  Include a version number roughly 2-3 versions in the future, at which the deprecated version will
  be removed.
  Make sure you update the changelog, clearly stating which new feature replaces which old one in
  what circumstance.
  For deprecated config options use :meth:`~tenpy.tools.config.Config.deprecated_alias`.

- During development, you might introduce ``# TODO`` comments.  But also try to remove them again later!
  If you're not 100% sure that you will remove it soon, please add a doc-string with a 
  ``.. todo ::`` block, such that we can keep track of it.

  Unfinished functions should ``raise NotImplementedError()``.
- Summarize the changes you have made in the changelog. For PRs and larger changes, make a new file,
  and e.g. name it after the PR, ``doc/changelog/latest/pr_401.txt`` or similar. Make sure to use ``.txt`` suffix.
  It should contain only bullet points (``- `` followed by text, additional lines starting with two spaces).
  For very small changes, you may add to (or create, if it doesn't exist yet) ``doc/changelog/latest/misc.txt``.
- If you want to try out new things in temporary files: any folder named ``playground`` is ignored by `git`.
- If you add a new toycode or example: add a reference to include it in the documentation.
- We've created a sphinx extensions for `documenting config-option dictionaries <https://sphinx-cfg-options.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
  If a class takes a dictionary of options, we usually call it `options`, 
  convert it to a :class:`~tenpy.tools.params.Config` at the very beginning of the `__init__` with
  :func:`~tenpy.tools.params.asConfig`, save it as ``self.options``, 
  and document it in the class doc-string with a ``.. cfg:config ::`` directive.
  The name of the `config` should usually be the class-name (if that is sufficiently unique),
  or for algorithms directly the common name of the algorithm, e.g. "DMRG"; use the same name for the 
  use the same name for the documentation of the ``.. cfg:config ::`` directive as for the 
  :class:`~tenpy.tools.params.Config` class instance.
  Attributes which are simply read-out options should be documented by just referencing the options with the
  ``:cfg:option:`configname.optionname``` role.
