"""Optimization options for this library.

Let me start with a `quote <http://wiki.c2.com/?RulesOfOptimization>`_ of "Micheal Jackson"
(a programmer, not the musician)::

    First rule of optimization: "Don't do it."
    Second rule of optimization (for experts only): "Don't do it yet."
    Third rule of optimization: "Profile before optimizing."

Luckily, following the third optimization rule, namely profiling code, is
fairly simple in python, see the `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html>`_.
If you have a python script running your code, you can simply call it with
``python -m "cProfile" -s "tottime" your_script.py``. Alternatively, save the profiling statistics
with ``python -m "cProfile" -o "profile_data.stat" your_script.py`` and
run these few lines of python code::

    import pstats
    p = pstats.Pstats("profile_data.stat")
    p.sort_stats('cumtime')  # sort by 'cumtime' column
    p.print_stats(30)   # prints first 30 entries

That being said, I actually did profile and optimize (parts of) the library; and there are a few
knobs you can turn to tweak the most out of this library, explained in the following.

1) Simply install the 'bottleneck' python package, which allows to optimize slow parts of numpy,
   most notably 'NaN' checking.
2) Figure out which numpy/scipy/python you are using. As explained in :doc:`../INSTALL`,
   we recommend to use the Python distributed provided by Intel or Anaconda. They ship with numpy
   and scipy which use Intels MKL library, such that e.g. ``np.tensordot`` is parallelized to use
   multiple cores.
3) In case you didn't do that yet: some parts of the library are written in both python and Cython
   with the same interface, so you can simply compile the Cython code, as explained in
   :doc:`../INSTALL`. Then everything should work the same way from a user perspective,
   while internally the faster, pre-compiled cython code from ``tenpy/linalg/_npc_helper.pyx``
   is used. This should also be a safe thing to do.
   The replacement of the optimized functions is done by the decorator :func:`use_cython`.

   .. note ::

       By default, the compilation will link against the BLAS functions provided by
       :mod:`scipy.linalg.cython_blas`. Whether they use MKL depends on the scipy version you
       installed.
       However, you can explicitly link against a given MKL by providing the path during
       compilation, as explained in :ref:`linkingMKL`.

4) One of the great things about python is its dynamical nature - anything can be done at runtime.
   In that spirit, this module allows to set a global  "optimization level" which can be changed
   *dynamically* (i.e., during runtime) with :func:`set_level`. The library will then try some
   extra optimization, most notably skip sanity checks of arguments.
   The possible choices for this global level are given by the :class:`OptimizationFlag`.
   The default initial value for the global optimization level can be adjusted by the environment
   variable `TENPY_OPTIMIZE`.

   .. warning ::
        When this optimizing is enabled, we skip (some) sanity checks.
        Thus, errors will not be detected that easily, and debugging is much harder!
        We recommend to use this kind of optimization only for code which you successfully have run
        before with (very) similar parameters!
        Enable this optimization only during the parts of the code where it is really necessary.
        The context manager :class:`temporary_level` can help with that.
        Check whether it actually helps - if it doesn't, keep the optimization disabled!
        Some parts of the library already do that as well (e.g. DMRG after the first sweep).

5) You might want to try some different compile time options for the cython code, set in the
   `setup.py` in the top directory of the repository.
   Since the `setup.py` reads out the `TENPY_OPTIMIZE`
   environment variable, you can simple use an ``export TENPY_OPTIMIZE=3`` (in your bash/terminal)
   right before compilation. An ``export TENPY_OPTIMIZE=0`` activates profiling hooks instead.

   .. warning ::
       This increases the probability of getting segmentation faults and anyway might not
       help that much; in the crucial parts of the cython code, these optimizations are already
       applied. We do *not* recommend using this!

    This is a `decorator <https://docs.python.org/3.7/glossary.html#term-decorator>`_, which is
    supposed to be used in front of function definitions with an ``@`` sign, for example::

        @use_cython
        def my_slow_function(a):
            "some example function with slow python loops"
            result = 0.

                    result += np.cos(a[i, j]**2) * (i + j)
            return result

    This decorator indicates that there is a `Cython <https://cython.org>`_ implementation in
    the file ``tenpy/linalg/_npc_helper.pyx``, which should have the same signature (i.e. same
    arguments and return values) as the decorated function, and can be used as a replacement for
    the decorated function. However, if the cython code could not be compiled on your system
    (or if the environment variable ``TENPY_OPTIMIZE`` is set to negative values, or
    the environment variable ``TENPY_NO_CYTHON`` is "true"), we just pass the previous function.

    .. note ::
       In case that the decorator is used for a class method, the corresponding Cython version
       needs to have an ``@cython.binding(True)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        The defined function
    replacement : string | None
        The name of the function defined in ``tenpy/linalg/_npc_helper.pyx`` which should
        replace the decorated function.
        ``None`` defaults to the name of the decorated function,
        e.g., in the above example `my_slow_function`.
    check_doc : bool
        If True, we check that the cython version of the function has the exact same doc string
        (up to a possible first line containing the function signature) to exclude typos and
        inconsistent versions.

    Returns
    -------
    replacement_func : function
        The function replacing the decorated function `func`.
