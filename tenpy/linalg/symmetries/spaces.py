class VectorSpace:
    r"""A vector space, which decomposes into sectors of a given symmetry.

    Attributes
    ----------
    TODO incomplete
    sector_perm : 1D numpy array of int
        The permutation that defines how the `self.sectors` are embedded in the vector space.
        ``self.sectors[n]`` is the `sector_perm[n]`-th in the vector space.
        In other words, ``self.sectors == sectors_in_dense_space[sector_perm]``.
        The `sectors` argument that was originally passed to ``Vectorspace.__init__`` can be recovered
        as ``self._sectors[self.inverse_sector_perm]``
    slices : 2D numpy array of int
        For every sector ``self.sectors[n]``, this specifices the start (``slices[n, 0]``)
        and stop (``slices[n, 1]``) of indices on a dense array into which the sector is embedded.
        Note that ``slices[n, 1] - slices[n, 0] == symmetry.sectors_dim(sectors[n]) * multiplicities[n]``.


    Attributes
    ----------
    sectors : 2D np array of int
        The sectors that compose this space.
    _sectors: : 2D np array of int
        Internally stored version of :attr:`sectors`. These are the sectors of the "non-dual" ket-space,
        that is either equal (if `self.is_dual is False`) or isomorphic (if `self.is_dual is True`) to
        `self`. This allows us to bring the sectors in a canonical order that is the same for a space
        and its dual, by sorting `_sectors` instead of `sectors`.
    is_dual : bool
        Whether this is the dual (a.k.a. bra) space, composed of `sectors == symmtery.dual_sectors(_sectors)`
        or the regular (a.k.a. ket) space composed of `sectors == _sectors`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    symmetry: Symmetry
        The symmetry associated with this space.
    sectors: 2D array_like of int
        The sectors of the symmetry that compose this space.
        A 2D array of integers with axes [s, q] where s goes over different sectors
        and q over the different quantities needed to describe a sector.
        E.g. if the symmetry is :math:`U(1) \times Z_2`, then ``sectors[s, 0]`` gives the :math:`U(1)`
        charge for the `s`-th sector, and ``sectors[s, 1]`` the respective :math:`Z_2` charge.
        Sectors may not contain duplicates. Multiplicity is specified via the seperate arg below.
        The sectors are sorted before storing them. See :attr:`sector_perm`.
    multiplicities: 1D array_like of int
        How often each of the `sectors` appears. A 1D array of positive integers with axis [s].
        ``sectors[i_s, :]`` appears ``multiplicities[i_s]`` times.
        If not given, a multiplicity ``1`` is assumed for all `sectors`.
        Before storing, the multiplicities are permuted along with the `sectors` to sort the latter.
    is_real : bool
        Whether the space is over the real numbers. Otherwise it is over the complex numbers (default).
    _is_dual : bool
        Whether this is the "normal" (i.e. ket) or dual (i.e. bra) space.

        .. warning :
            For ``_is_dual is True``, the passed `sectors` are interpreted as the sectors of the
            ("non-dual") ket-space isomorphic to self.
            They are stored as ``self._sectors``, while ``self.sectors``, accessed via the property,
            are the duals of `sectors == self._sectors` if ``_is_dual is True``.
            This means that to construct the dual of ``VectorSpace(..., some_sectors)``,
            we need to call ``VectorSpace(..., some_sectors, _is_dual=True)`` and in particular
            pass the *same* sectors.
            Consider using ``VectorSpace(..., some_sectors).dual`` instead for more readable code.

    _sector_perm : 1D array-like of int, optional
        Allows to skip the sorting of sectors. If `sector_perm` is given, the `sectors` are assumed
        to be sorted (this is not checked!) and we store this permutation as :attr:`sector_perm`.
    _slices : 2D array-like
        Allows to skip recomputing the :attr:`slices`. These are the slices *after* sorting.

    |                 self

    It is the product space of the individual `spaces`,
    but with an associated basis change implied to allow preserving the symmetry.

    .. note ::
        While mathematically the dual of the product :math:`(V \otimes W)^*` is the same as the
        product of the duals :math:`V^* \otimes W^*`, we distinguish these two objects in the
        implementation. This allows us to fulfill all of the following constraints
        a) Have the same order of `_sectors` for a space and its dual, to make contractions easier.
        b) Consistently view every ProductSpace as a VectorSpace, i.e. have proper subclass behavior
           and in particular a well-behaved `is_dual` attribute.
        c) A ProductSpace can always be split into its :attr:`spaces`.

        As an example, consider two VectorSpaces ``V`` and ``W`` and the following four possible
        products::

            ==== ============================ ================== ========= =================
                 Mathematical Expression      .spaces            .is_dual  ._sectors
            ==== ============================ ================== ========= =================
            P1   :math:`V \otimes W`          [V, W]             False     P1._sectors
            P2   :math:`(V \otimes W)^*`      [V.dual, W.dual]   True      P1._sectors
            P3   :math:`V^* \otimes W^*`      [V.dual, W.dual]   False     dual(P1._sectors)
            P4   :math:`(V^* \otimes W^*)^*`  [V, W]             True      dual(P1._sectors)
            ==== ============================ ================== ========= =================

        They can be related to each other via the :attr:`dual` property or via :meth:`flip_is_dual`.
        In this example we have `P1.dual == P2`` and ``P3.dual == P4``, as well as
        ``P1.flip_is_dual() == P4`` and ``P2.flip_is_dual() == P3``.

        The mutually dual spaces, e.g. ``P1`` and ``P2``, can contracted with each other, as they
        have opposite :attr:`is_dual` and matching :attr:`._sectors`.
        The spaces related by :meth:`flip_is_dual()`, e.g. ``P2`` and ``P3``, would be considered
        the same space mathematically, but in this implementation we have ``P2 != P3`` due to the
        different :attr:`is_dual` attribute.
        Since they represent the same space, they have the same entries in :attr:`sectors` (no
        underscore!), but not necessarily in the same order; due to the different :attr:`is_dual`,
        their :attr:`_sectors` are different and we sort by :attr:`_sectors`, not :attr:`sectors`.
        This also means that ``P1.can_contract_with(P3) is False``.
        The contraction can be done, however, by first converting ``P3.flip_is_dual() == P2``,
        since then ``P1.can_contract_with(P2) is True``.
        # TODO (JU) is there a corresponding function that does this on a tensor? -> reference it.

        This convention has the downside that the mathematical notation :math:`P_2 = (V \otimes W)^*`
        does not transcribe trivially into a single call of ``ProductSpace.__init__``, since
        ``P2 = ProductSpace([V.dual, W.dual], is_dual=True)``.
        Consider writing ``P2 = ProductSpace([V, W]).dual`` instead for more readable code,
        if performance is not critical.
