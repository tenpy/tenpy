r"""(More) robust version of singular value decomposition.

We often need to perform an SVD.
In general, an SVD is a matrix factorization that is always well defined and should also work
for ill-conditioned matrices.
But sadly, both :func:`numpy.linalg.svd` and :func:`scipy.linalg.svd` fail from time to time,
raising ``LinalgError("SVD did not converge")``.
The reason is that both of them call the LAPACK function `#gesdd`
(where `#` depends on the data type), which takes an iterative approach that can fail.
However, it is usually much faster than the alternative (and robust) `#gesvd`.

Our workaround is as follows: we provide a function :func:`svd` with call signature as scipy's svd.
This function is basically just a wrapper around scipy's svd, i.e., we keep calling the faster
`dgesdd`. But if that fails, we can still use `dgesvd` as a backup.

Sadly, `dgesvd` and `zgesvd` were not included into scipy until version '0.18.0' (nor in numpy),
which is as the time of this writing the latest stable scipy version.
For scipy version newer than '0.18.0', we make use of the new keyword 'lapack_driver' for svd,
otherwise we (try to) load `dgesvd` and `zgesvd` from shared LAPACK libraries.

The tribute for the dgesvd wrapper code goes to 'jgarcke', originally posted at
``http://projects.scipy.org/numpy/ticket/990``, which is now hosted
at https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/1588
He explains a bit more in detail what fails.

The include of `dgesvd` to scipy was done in https://github.com/scipy/scipy/pull/5994.


Examples
--------
The idea is that you just import the `svd` from this module and use it as replacement for
``np.linalg.svd`` or ``scipy.linalg.svd``:

>>> from tenpy.linalg.svd_robust import svd
>>> U, S, VT = svd([[1., 1.], [0., 1.]])

    Parameters
    ----------
    overwrite_a : bool
        Ignored (i.e. set to ``False``) if ``lapack_driver='gesdd'``.
        Otherwise described in :func:`scipy.linalg.svd`.
    lapack_driver : {'gesdd', 'gesvd'}, optional
        Whether to use the more efficient divide-and-conquer approach (``'gesdd'``)
        or general rectangular approach (``'gesvd'``) to compute the SVD.
        MATLAB and Octave use the ``'gesvd'`` approach.
        Default is ``'gesdd'``.
        If ``'gesdd'`` fails, ``'gesvd'`` is used as backup.
    warn : bool
        Whether to create a warning when the SVD failed.


    Returns
    -------
    U, S, Vh : ndarray
        As described in doc-string of :func:`scipy.linalg.svd`.
